Over the course of my career, I have demonstrated exceptional dedication to the
study of forest regeneration, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, addressing critical
issues such as carbon sequestration, plant invasion and the impact of climate change
on biodiversity. I have published 227 articles in prestigious journals such as Nature (3
articles), PNAS, USA (2 articles), Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution (2 articles), Nature
Communication (2 articles), Nature Plants, Science Advances, Global Ecology and
Biogeography (2 articles), Journal of Ecology, Nature Scientific Report, Critical Review
in Biotechnology, The Science of the Total Environment, Biotropica, Conservation
Biology etc., five books and 66 chapters. My scholarly achievements have been
recognized on a global scale, earning me prestigious accolades, fellowships, and
awards. I received 7th Visitor Award for Research in Biological Sciences, conferred by
the President of India on 10th July, 2023. I am fellow of National Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, New Delhi, Linnean Society, London, UK, Royal Society of
Biology, London, UK. I am also featured in the list of 2% Scientists published by
Stanford University, USA.
