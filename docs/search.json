She is broadly interested in understanding how species interactions and ecosystem functions are influenced by ongoing global changes and biodiversity loss. Her research uses theoretical models, experimental data, observational field data, and more recently, remote sensing techniques to study both spatial and temporal trends in responses of plant communities.\nKeywords:  Biodiversity, Global changes, species interactions, functional traits\n Publications  ORCiD  Website\n\n\n\n\n Back to member directory"
